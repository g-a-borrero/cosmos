# Medical

Being able to care for a person, whether it be yourself or somebody else, is an extremely useful skill to have. The reality is, most people are not able to care for their own injuries and ailments.

## Diagnose

Identify what may be wrong with an individual by considering all the information provided on their symptoms.

## First-Aid

Fixing a dislocated arm, wrapping an injury, treating a head cold; all these are examples of First-Aid. **Requires relevant tools.**

## Surgery

Performing surgery can save a person's life where First-Aid and health potions fail. **Requires relevant tools.**

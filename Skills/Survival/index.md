# Survival

Being able to gather what you need to survive in any environment and knowing what you need to do so go hand-in-hand.

## Natural

When people think of Survival skills, they imagine someone making a lean-to in the middle of nowhere.

## Space

Finding resources to collect in space, knowing which stations and start systems are safe and which are not, avoiding space beasts, all qualify as Space Survival.

## Underbelly

Who knows who, where they rank, and how to get a hit or fix are all part of Underbelly Survival.

## Urban

Knowing who not to tick off, which guards are on watch where, and which well-to-do restaurants don't guard their garbages well are all essential Urban Survival skills.

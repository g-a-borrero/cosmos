# Diplomacy

Sometimes we players don't have the words we need to convince an NPC to generally do what we want. In these instances, we can rely on Diplomacy.

## Allure

Using your charming personality you can get an NPC to consider your desires more seriously.

## Charity

Using your or another's destitute situation you can garner aid for yourself or the aforementioned unfortunate person.

## Persuasion

Using your words to get another to agree with your point of view.

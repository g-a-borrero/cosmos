# Intuition

Sometimes, as people, we have instant feelings about a person or situation that guide our steps. If you are unsure how your character would discern a situation, you may roll for Intuition instead.

## Analyze

Figure out if someone or something is something you would want to associate with.

## Honesty

Determine whether what you sense (see, smell, feel, hear, taste) is real.

## Visceral

Also known as a gut feeling, this check is for knowing whether your character would value fight, flight, or freeze more in a given situation.

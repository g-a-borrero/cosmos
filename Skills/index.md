# Skills

Just as in Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and many other games, COSMOS has a number of skills.

## Sub-Skills

Some skills can be broken down further into Sub-Skills. During character creation, when assigning skill points, you may choose to break a skill point into two sub-skill points. Those points then can go into a given sub-skill.

For example, Aiming. You are making a brawler sort of character and really don't care about magic or thrown weapons. You might decide to take a point and make it into two sub-skill points that you then assign into Aiming: Melee. Next time you need to throw a weapon it might not go so well, but what matters to you is how likely you are to strike your target!

During character creation, you cannot go above 7 points in a given skill or a given sub-skill. Using the above example, you could put 7 points into Aiming and then 7 sub-skill points into Aiming: Melee, giving you a whopping 15d20 to roll to hit! It's also possible to put no points into Aiming and 7 sub-skill points into Aiming: Melee, meaning you roll 1d20 when throwing a weapon but 8d20 when attacking with a melee weapon.

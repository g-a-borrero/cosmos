# Crafting

Trying to earn some ‚≠ê<sup>Insert Money Unit Here</sup> can be quite difficult. A way to make money, or save money, is to make your own items! Keep in mind in order to make your own items, you will need the materials required to make them.

## Clothes

How you look can affect how others view you. Clothing is a great way to increase your diplomatic influence. Clothing must be actively referenced in a character's post to reap the benefits of wearing it in a social setting. **Remember: You are capped at 7 for any Skill or Sub-Skill.**

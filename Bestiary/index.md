# Bestiary

As you play this game, you are going to want to create NPCs. Creating NPCs follow largely the same process as creating PCs - you assign Statistics, you assign Factors, you assign Skills, and if relevant to the game, you assign Abilities and Items.

You may decide to use the chart below to modify the starting Statistic and Skill points for your game. The column `Creatures` are more to evoke the level of intelligence and skills a given creature might have.

| Creatures | Statistic Points | Skill Points |
|:---------:|:----------------:|:------------:|
| Domestic Animal | 5 | 15 |
| Intelligent Animal | 10 | 25 |
| Human-like | 15 | 50 |
| Superhuman | 25 | 75 |
| God-like | 50 | 100 |

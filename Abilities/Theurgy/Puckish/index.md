## Belief

#### Befuddle
> **Requirements:** Belief.
>
> *Active. One target in twice Movement Speed range.*
> 
> The user confounds one target in range. Every time they go to take an action, they must attempt a Knowledge: Faith (not Knowledge and Faith... just the number for Faith) + Intuition roll. On a Wild Success, the user performs their action and is no longer Befuddled. On a Caveat, they perform their action as planned and are still Befuddled. On a Failure, the Befuddled target performs their planned action on themselves if targetted or in an unexpected way if untargetted.

#### Trip
> **Requirements:** Belief.
>
> *Active. One target in Movement Speed range.*
>
> Trip a target causing them to fall forward or backward 5 ft; takes an action to stand.

## Reverence

#### Tumult
> **Requirements:** Reverence.
>
> *Active. All non-allies in hearing (typically 250 ft radius) distance.*
>
> ***3d8 damage.*** The user stirs three or more people in range into making such a ruckus that the sound overwhelms the senses. Damage evenly spread across all non-allies.

#### Procure
> **Requirements:** Reverence.
>
> *Active. One target in twice Movement Speed range.*
>
> Pick a target and randomly receive an object on their person - from money to clothing to weaponry and more.

## Piety

#### Disassemble
> **Requirements:** Piety.
>
> *Active. One object in sight.*
>
> Cause an object to spontaneously break down into its components.

#### Discord
> **Requirements:** Piety.
> 
> *Active. 1 Theurgy per target within 5 ft. Lasts 1 minute, increasing by 1 Theurgy per extra minute up to 10 for "permanently."*
> 
> The user blocks their target(s) from using Abilities for a given amount of time - nothing is truly permanent, as it can be undone.

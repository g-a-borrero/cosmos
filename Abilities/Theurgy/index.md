# Theurgy

Theurgy, both the statistics and the Abilities therein, share a name because of the shared nature of their existence. Theurgical abilities rely on belief and response from another, supernatural, *often* untouchable entity. Your Theurgy statistic determines how many Theurgical abilities you can use in a single wake cycle.

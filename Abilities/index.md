# Abilities

These abilities go beyond the normal. Called "spells" in some systems, there are three broad categories to be found: Magic, Psi, and Theurgy. Your GM may have ways for differentiating the three that differs from the base system, so always talk to them first and take the flavor text here with a grain of salt!

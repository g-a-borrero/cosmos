# Items

There are a variety of items that you can use in the game. The amount of starting currency you have will be determined by your GM, if any. Your GM may decide to instead start you with a set of equipment. Alternatively... your GM may start you with absolutely nothing, in which case, reading this page is masochism on the player's part.

Each item's value is determined based off of a food staple, such as rice, wheat, so on and so forth. The number you will see is not the price in a given currency, but how much it should cost compared to a food staple in a society like our own. <sub><sup>**Creator's Confession:** To get these costs, I looked them up, then divided the price found by the price for a cup of uncooked rice.</sup></sub>

Each item takes up 1 Inventory Space, whether it is worn or not, unless otherwise specified. Some items (like backpacks) will hold additional items for you.

Please note there is not a 1-to-1 ratio between the cost of raw materials and the cost of something already-made.

Lastly, just because the item is listed here does not mean your GM has to use it in their game. A GM can say "my game does not have guns" and that's the end of it. If they want to, they can say "my game doesn't have metal" and that's the end of that, too. Pay attention to your GM's rules.

### Composition

There may be other materials weapons may be made of - speak to your GM!

| Gemstone | +5 | 2.5x | May break on a Caveat |
| Obsidian | +10 | 5x | Will break on a Caveat |

### Melee

Melee weapons do a variable amount of damage depending on their composition. As they are not thrown weapons, throwing one will cause them to do 0.5x damage and you must using Aiming without a sub-skill (Aiming+Aiming) to attempt a throw.

| Item | Cost | Damage | Two-Handed Effects |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|:------------------:|
| Axe | 160 | 2d8 | 1.5x damage |
| Club | 340 | 2d6 | Aiming Action Score +5 |

| Sword, Broad | 1,640 | 6d4-5 | Aiming Action Score +5, +5 damage, x5 damage |
| Sword, Thin (e.g., Rapier) | 800 | 3d4 | Aiming Action Score -5 and 1.5x damage |

#### Polearms

These melee weapons have a range of 10 ft. and can hit up to two targets in a line from the combatant.

| Item | Cost | Damage |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|
| Glaive | 840 | 4d6 |
| Halberd | 412 | 2d8 |
| Trident | 800 | 3d8 |

### Ranged, Gun

This... is up to your GM unless I, Gab, do some heavy research. Even with research, your GM may have their own ideas. Trust in your GM.

### Ranged, Other

#### Throwing Weapons

Range is Movement Speed + (Dexterity or Strength x 5) of the thrower.

| Item | Cost | Ranged Damage | Melee Damage | Two-Handed Effects |
|:----:|:----:|:-------------:|:------------:|:------------------:|
| Axe, Throwing | 480 | 2d8+2 | 1d8 | Aiming Action Score +5 |
| Chakram | 287 | 3d4 | 1d12 | Aiming Action Score -10 |
| Dagger | 240 | 2d2 | 2d2-1 | Aiming Action Score +5 and 2x damage |
| Knife, Paring | 360 | 3d2 | 1d6-1 | Aiming Action Score +5 and 1.5x damage |
| Spear | 500 | 2d8 | 2d8 | 1.5x damage |
| Throwing Star, Small | 20 | 1d8 | 1d4-2 | Aiming Action Score -10 |
| Throwing Star, Medium | 40 | 2d4 | 1d4-1 | Aiming Action Score -10 |
| Throwing Star, Large | 80 | 2d6 | 1d4 | Aiming Action Score -10 |
| Throwing Star, Extra Large | 160 | 3d4 | 2d4-2 | Aiming Action Score -10 |

#### Ammo-Using Ranged Weapons

Range is 1x to 10x Movement Speed of the shooter. Shooting outside of that range incurs a Challenge Score increase of 5 per 5 ft outside of that range. Example: 20ft Movement Speed character. The range of one of the ranged weapons would be 20 ft to 200 ft. If the character tried to shoot at 5 ft range... 20-5 = 15. Challenge Score increase of 15. If the character tried to shoot at 215 ft range, 215-200 = 15. Challenge Score increase of 15.

Recharging one of the following uses an action.

| Item | Cost | Ranged Damage | Melee Damage | Ammo |
|:----:|:----:|:-------------:|:------------:|:----:|
| Bow, Long | 1,320 | 1.5x | 1d6 | Arrow |

| Crossbow | 1,440 | 1x | 1d4 | Bolt |
| Blowpipe | 740 | 1x | 1 | Dart |

##### Ammo

Ammo takes up 0.01 Inventory Space. Attempting to use them without their proper weapon will do a maximum of 1 damage. The material composition of the ammo plays a role in its damage as well.

|:----:|:----:|:------:|
| Arrow | 160 | 1d6 |
| Bolt | 28 | 1d8 |

## Vehicles

Vehicles vary by setting amd additions. Your setting may not have wheels, for example. Speak with your GM. The cost of a vehicle also varies by setting and timeframe. Again, speak to your GM. Below are vehicles that take 10 people or less. For larger vehicles, such as ships of the sea and space faring kind... reconsider. Please reconsider. Please don't make me price it out. Your GM may be willing, but I am begging you as the COSMOS's creator, have mercy.

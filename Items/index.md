# Items

There are a variety of items that you can use in the game. The amount of starting currency you have will be determined by your GM, if any. Your GM may decide to instead start you with a set of equipment. Alternatively... your GM may start you with absolutely nothing, in which case, reading this page is masochism on the player's part.

Each item's value is determined based off of a food staple, such as rice, wheat, so on and so forth. The number you will see is not the price in a given currency, but how much it should cost compared to a food staple in a society like our own.

Lastly, just because the item is listed here does not mean your GM has to use it in their game. A GM can say "my game does not have guns" and that's the end of it. If they want to, they can say "my game doesn't have metal" and that's the end of that, too. Pay attention to your GM's rules.

<sub><sup>**Creator's Confession:** To get these costs, I looked them up, then divided the price found by the price for a cup of uncooked rice.</sup></sub>

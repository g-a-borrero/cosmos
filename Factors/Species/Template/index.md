# Template

The basic bread and butter of your setting. If a pre-existing template exists for a given species, you may use that.

## Body

Give the number of Physical Traits a character of this species should have. Then list the suggested Physical Traits.

## Traits

In total, a character should have five traits from their Species. Subtract the number of traits from Body to get the remaining number of traits your character can sample.

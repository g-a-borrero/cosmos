# Template

The basic bread and butter of your setting. If a pre-existing template exists for a given species, you may use that.

## Body

Give the number of Physical Traits a character of this species should have up to a maximum of six (6). Then list the suggested Physical Traits. A player may choose to remove or add on Physical Traits as they see fit, so long as it remains that the Body has no more than six (6) Traits.

## Traits

In total, a character should have eight (8) traits from their Species. Subtract the number of traits from Body to get the remaining number of non-Physical traits your character can sample. Traits from previous Factors do not count against this total. The player of this character should be picking out the remaining Traits, not the GM.

# Atmosphere

Atmosphere here does not refer to the composition of a planet's atmosphere, but where your character primarily lives. For example, a human on Earth's Atmosphere would be solid, as they (as of 2023) live primarily on land. A fish's would be liquid, and a dragonfly's would be gas. Some creature that lives in space would be void.

Sometimes creatures have two primary atmospheres. Refer to your GM to discover their various speeds!

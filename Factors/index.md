# Factors

What goes into a person and their character? Many, many things. We call these "things" *Factors*. And with Factors, we come to understand who a character is.

Some Factors include:

* Heavenly Bodies
* Atmosphere
* Geography
* Community
* Family
* Species

Each of these play a role in the creation process of both PCs and NPCs.

# Amphibious

*Physical.*

Characters that are suited to both underwater and land life are said to be amphibious. This trait typically comes as a result of a need to protect themselves or find more food.

## Effects

* Observe whether your Walking or Swimming Speeds are higher. Whichever is higher is now the value of the other as well.

# Bonds

*Social.*

What sort of attachments your character has to others.

## Effects

May be taken once for each type. You character gains +1d when working or interacting with their corresponding Trait selection. These do stack - so if your character has a bond with their sibling and a bond with their family, then they would get +2d when interacting with their sibling.

* **Self:** List one to three goals.
* **Person:** Pick one character, PC or NPC besides your character.
* **Group:** Pick a crew, family, or set of friends.
* **Neighborhood:** Pick one small neighborhood, village, or town.
* **Party:** Pick one political party, sports team, or religious sect.

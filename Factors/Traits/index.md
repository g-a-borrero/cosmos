# Traits

Finally, there are Traits that go into each character. These might have been determined by other Factors or be ones picked especially for a character. Regardless, keep in mind that your Traits should make sense for your character. Generally speaking, traits have one or two effects and can be broadly categorized as

* Combat
* Physical
* Social

Please note that unless a trait states otherwise, you can only take it once.

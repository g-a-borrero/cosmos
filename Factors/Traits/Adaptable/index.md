# Adaptable

*Physical.*

You have experience living in two different kinds of Atmospheres. Doing so has allowed you to quickly adapt to the difference between the two, and you are always ready to handle any situation.

## Effects

* Choose a second [Atmosphere](/cosmos/Factors/Atmosphere). Update your Movement Speed such that you always have the highest Movement Speed from both your origin Atmosphere and the secondary Atmosphere you have selected. Use this number for calculations of the derivative speeds.

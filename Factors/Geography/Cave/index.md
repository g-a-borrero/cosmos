# Cave

**Type:** Land, Water.

Carved into the earth, caves are dark, cold, and clammy. Light cannot be found sufficiently within these geographic features. If light is a requirement for life, then it could be said only some of the hardiest of creatures can survive the darkness with their minds intact.

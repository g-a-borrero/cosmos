Started on Christmas Day, 2023, but imagined for far longer. This system takes influence from games such as GURPS, Pathfinder, Ironsworn, and more.

# The Goal

Create a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) that can be played online via written message. The game should offer as many options as possible for characters without them becoming overbearing.

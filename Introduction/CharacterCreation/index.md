# Character Creation

[This Character Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPXXCyO4wewCdtU_ieo88l3QJl4NqouRFuo75SmuRNk/edit?usp=sharing) can help you create a character from scratch. You will need to make a copy of the document to your Google Drive. Please keep in mind this only handles mechanics - your backstory and relationships should be handled in a separate document.

The steps you use to make a character are as follows:

1. Statistics
2. Factors
3. Skills
4. (Optional) Abilities

## Statistics

You have 15 points to allocate into Statistics as you see fit.

## Factors

Go through the following Factors in order, assigning them to your character as you go:

1. Heavenly Bodies
2. Atmosphere
3. Geography
4. Community
5. Family
6. Species
   * Traits
       * In total, a character should have eight (8) traits from their Species. Subtract the number of traits from Body to get the remaining number of non-Physical traits your character can sample. Traits from previous factors do not count against this total.

## Skills

You have 25 points points to allocate into Skills as you see fit. One Skill point may be split into two Sub-Skill points. You can have no more than a value of 3 in an individual Skill or 6 in a Sub-Skill. (3 Diplomacy, 6 Diplomacy: Charity.)

A Skill value of 4 gives you five (5) dice to roll for that Skill, which is essentially a coinflip.

## Abilities

There are three kinds of Abilities - Psi, Magic, and Theurgy. To gain these Abilities, you may take either Headstrong (Psi), Gifted (Magic), or Touched (Theurgy) once, or Improved (any) one or more times. Please note that these skills and Abilities may not be part of your setting, so it's best to talk to your GM first!

# Character Creation

The steps you use to make a character are as follows:

1. Statistics
2. Factors
3. Skills
4. (Optional) Abilities

## Statistics

You have 15 points to allocate into Statistics as you see fit.

## Factors

Go through the following Factors in order, assigning them to your character as you go:

1. Heavenly Bodies
2. Atmosphere
3. Geography
4. Community
5. Family
6. Species
   * Traits

## Skills

You have 50 points points to allocate into Skills as you see fit. One Skill point may be split into two Sub-Skill points.

A Skill value of 4 gives you five (5) dice to roll for that Skill, which is essentially a coinflip.

## Abilities

There are three kinds of Abilities - Psi, Magic, and Theurgy. To gain these Abilities, you may take either Headstrong (Psi), Gifted (Magic), or Touched (Theurgy) once, or Improved (any) one or more times.

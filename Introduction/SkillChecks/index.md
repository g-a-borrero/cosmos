# Skill Checks

Those familiar with Ironsworn will definitely see the influence here in how skill checks operate. It is considered good form to confirm with your GM before you roll a skill check; a GM may decide *for you* what a skill check is or otherwise invalidate it if you roll without confirmation.

## The Dice

Luckily, this game is run using the Power of the Internet (TM) so the dice being used are easily accessible via various dice rollers, either as Discord Bots, forum functionalities, or websites. What you will need to play in-person (why would you do this?) are:

* Ten 20-sided die (or one 20-sided die and something to write on)
* Two sets of 100-sided die (or one set of 100-sided die and something to write on)

## How it Works

You have your action dice - between one and ten 20-sided die - and your two 100-sided challenge die.

1. Ask your GM what the check entails. They will tell you which skill and statistic to use.
2. Determine how many Action Dice you will be rolling. This is done by looking at your Skills and Sub-Skills. You will be rolling 1 + the number for a given Skill total die + the number for a given Sub-Skill of that Skill if applicable. This is a maximum of 10 die.
3. Roll the dice, and then add on your statistic. This is your Action Score.
4. Roll the two 100-sided die. Your GM may add values onto these depending on how difficult the task is. The two resulting numbers are your two Challenge Scores.
    1. If you meet or beat both Challenge Scores: **Wild Success!** You have succeeded and then some! Your GM will describe your success to you.
    2. If you meet or beat one Challenge Score: **Caveat.** You have succeeded, but with a caveat. Your GM will describe your success and caveat to you.
    3. If you fail to beat both Challenge Scores: **Fail...** You have failed. Your GM will describe your failure to you.

## Assisted Skill Checks

If two or more of your group would like to attempt a Skill Check, the mechanism is a little different. Instead of everyone rolling individually...

1. The group's average Skill Value for a given Skill is calculated.
2. Add on everyone's bonuses (for example, [Stalwart](/cosmos/Factors/Traits/Stalwart)).
3. That Skill Value, plus one, is the number of die you will be rolling - up to a maximum of 10.
4. Decide who is doing the rolling and roll the Action Die.
5. Add on the relevant, agreed upon Statistic from the entire group. This is your Action Score.
6. Roll the Challenge Die.
7. Consider any Traits that might pertain to the Challenge Roll from the group (such as [Inquisitive](/cosmos/Factors/Traits/Inquisitive)) and calculate your two Challenge Scores.
8. Refer to the list beneath the fourth step in "How It Works" above.

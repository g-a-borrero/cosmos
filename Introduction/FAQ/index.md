# FAQ

The questions that have been asked more than once and deserve an answer.

## My game takes place on Earth, everyone is from Earth. What's the Movement Speed of the characters?

Base Movement Speed for characters on Earth, from Earth, is 25 ft.

## What's the difference between the different speeds?

Movement Speed determines your Flying, Swimming, and Walking Speeds. Movement Speed is meta, basically refers to how swift your character is in general. Flying Speed is for aerial travels such as birds flying through the sky; Swimming Speed is for liquid travels such as fish swimming through the ocean; Walking Speed is for solid travels such as a dog walking on land.

# Movement

Getting around is a lot of fun, but knowing how to do it is important.

## Character Movement

In order to determine a character's movements, we have to know some things about them. Namely, their origin [Heavenly Body](/cosmos/Factors/HeavenlyBody), their current Heavenly Body, their origin [Atmosphere](/../../Factors/Atmosphere).

### Movement Speed

Also referred to as **Base Movement Speed**. This is determined by observing the graph for Heavenly Bodies. First identify where your character is from on the left-most column. Then determine what current type of Heavenly Body they're currently on or in from the top row, and go down until you match both the correct column with the row of your origin Heavenly Body. This is your Base Movement Speed and will give you your other movements.

Characters who have the Field Factor gain an additional 5 ft. of Movement Speed.

### Flying

Also referred to as **Flying Speed**. This is how far your character can fly in a turn. Characters whose origins are primarily in or on liquids (water, for example) or solids (land, for example) have no Flying Speed. Characters who primarily live in the Void (space, for example) have a Flying Speed equal to half their Base Movement Speed. Characters who primarily live in gasses (air, for example) have a Flying Speed equal to their Movement Speed.

Characters with the Wings Train gain additional Flying Speed equal to half their Movement Speed.

### Swimming

Also referred to as **Swimming Speed**. This is how far your character can swim in a turn. Characters whose origins are primarily gas dwellers (air, for example) have no Swimming Speed. Characters who primarily live on solids (land, for example) have a Swimming Speed equal to half their Movement Speed. Characters who primarily live in liquids (water, for example) or in the Void (space, for example) have a Swimming Speed equal to their Movement Speed.

Characters with the Fins Trait gain additional Swimming Speed equal to half their Movement Speed.

### Walking

Also referred to as **Walking Speed**. This is how far your character can walk in a turn. Characters whose origins are primarily the Void (space, for example) have no Walking Speed. Characters who primarily live in gasses (air, for example) or liquids (water, for example) have a Walking Speed equal to half their Movement Speed. Characters who primarily live on solids (land, for example) have a Walking Speed equal to their Movement Speed.

Characters with the Legs Trait gain additional Walking Speed equal to half their Movement Speed.

### Climbing

Also referred to as **Climbing Speed**. This is how fast your character can climb in a turn. It is equal to half your Movement Speed unless you have the Climber Trait; then it is equal to your previous Movement, regardless of type.

### Jumper

Also referred to as **Jumping Speed** or **Jumping Height**. This is how far your character can jump in a turn. It is equal to one quarter your Movement Speed, rounded to the nearest multiple of 5. Those with the Jumper Trait have it equal to their previous Movement, regardless of type.

# Movement

Getting around is a lot of fun, but knowing how to do it is important.

## Character Movement

In order to determine a character's movements, we have to know some things about them. Namely, their origin Heavenly Body, their current [Heavenly Body](/cosmos/Factors/HeavenlyBody) their origin [Atmosphere](/../../Factors/Atmosphere).

### Movement Speed

Also referred to as **Base Movement Speed**. This is determined by observing the graph for Heavenly Bodies. First identify where your character is from on the left-most column. Then determine what current type of Heavenly Body they're currently on or in from the top row, and go down until you match both the correct column with the row of your origin Heavenly Body. This is your Base Movement Speed and will give you your other movements.

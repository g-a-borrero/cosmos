# Initiative

The turn order of combat is known as initiative. You and everyone at the table participating in combat must take turns. In most games, that is done by rolling for a place on a list and then considering other factors that will move you up the list.

In COSMOS, you do not roll for initiative; it is determined by the alphanumerical order of names of all characters, PC and NPC alike, involved. Then, if anyone has any Traits that causes them to move up or down in initiative, they do so. The list is confirmed and finalized by the GM, and then everyone works their way down the list.

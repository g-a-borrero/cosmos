# Combat

This is not a game that is centered around combat by design, but it does have the ability to handle instances where fighting occurs. Before engaging in combat, recognize that a character fighting another may be viewed negatively by others. Also realize that others may not understand your character was targetted, if they arrive after combat has started. *Combat has consequences.*
